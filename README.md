# ARES and SEDs

Greetings, dear reader. It is here that you can use the Luberto et al. template for SED fitting with EAZY.

The files themselves are in the repo, as are tutorials showing how to do more stuff with it than running in native EAZY. With them we can recover full (predicted) SFHs, for instance.
